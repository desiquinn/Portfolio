    <section>
        <h3>Hello, I'm Desiree Morris</h3>
        <h4>Full Stack Web Developer With an Eye For Design</h4>
        <p>I first taught myself how to code using HTML and CSS when I was 12 years old after my grandmother introduced 
            me to web development in the 90s. I used it mostly as a hobby as I met people in chat rooms 
            and participated in web design and graphic design challenges. In 2004 I went to Western Carolina University 
            and majored in Entrepreneurship and Graphic Design</p>
        <p>At Western Carolina University I landed my first job as a Junior Web Designer for 
            the University’s Website. I also became the go to person to design and maintain student organizations, and 
            department specific websites. After 3 years I left that job and transferred to a different school.  
            I graduated with my bachelor’s degree in biology and began working in the medical field.
            During that time I went back to building websites for friends and family as a hobby.</p>
        <p>In 2018, I decided to leave my medical career behind and get serious about my first love, 
            Web Development.  For a two years I freelanced for small businesses.  During that time I 
            decided I wanted to learn more and become a Full Stack Web Developer. I began looking for ways 
            to increase and modernize my skill set when I decided to enroll in Lambda School. </p>
        <p>Lambda School is a 9 month Computer Science & Software Engineering Academy.  I enrolled in the 
            Web Development & Computer Science track that provided me with an immersive hands-on 
            curriculum.</p>
        <p> The following projects are a mixture of Lambda School projects, personal projects, and experiments
            that showcase my Full Stack Web Development skills as well as my Web Design skills.</p>
